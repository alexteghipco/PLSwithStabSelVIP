# Partial-least squares with VIP-based stability selection
Train and test a tuned PLS model, either on its own or with Variable Importance Projection (VIP) as a feature selection procedure inside of stability selection

Note, you need stability selection to run this: https://github.com/alexteghipco/StabilitySelection

Also note, this is a work in progress! Send any bugs my way: alex.teghipco@sc.edu
